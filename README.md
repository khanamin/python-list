How to play with list in python!
Q) #Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list
#of words using the split() method. The program should build a list of words. For each word
#on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the
#list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.

*Use data file romeo.txt or any text file you eant to use.
